how to use :
1) do not send multiple request at the same time from different local models
2) FIXED - send no more than about 20 samples each time

missing part :
3) FIXED - training with central data
4) FIXED - predict with central data
5) choose local and global model -> now by defalut is dt4


there are still some errors -> check the procedure
- create local model
- add data to central
- train central
- predict request
- add other data to central
- train central
- predict request again

See the notebook client and server -> first launch the server!
