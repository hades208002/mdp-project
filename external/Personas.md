- First AF attack : in 2011, while sitting at her desk at work.
- Life Style : Sedentary (?)
- Story : Couple of episodes in two years. Three solutions proposed the cardiologist (1. do nothing, 2. take medicine, 3. have an ablation [not recommended]). She opted for medicine, but that was interfering with her sleeping, so she stopped. AF attacks repeated every 4-6 months, with an heartbeat of about 180 bpm [a fish trying to push throught my chest ;) ]. Being a Christion, she decided to seek help in a church. She asked her pastor to anoint her with oil and pray over me for healing - as laid out in the book of James. They did that, and she did not have another AF attack for 15 months! After the next attack she considered to get a CryoAblation. The operation succeed, She is AF free, but she later became Persistent PVCs
- Goals ? -> same as before?
Considerations? Tibetan Medicine: a Man is not only a body, but also a mind and a spirit. Is focusing only on the "body" ( like Western medicine does) enough to cure diseases? .
